# ADDING Ideas:
Traffic situational awareness app 
using Semi Blockchain technology
Description:-I t will be an app which will enable users 
to see through corners while driving in accident 
hotspots. It will also tell the likelihood of getting 
bumped to another car while driving(both cars need 
to use this application).

Skills needed:
Android development
basic knowledge of cryptography
Networking
Python(Google map API,Socket programming,API to simulate 2D kinematics)

Features:
It'll reduce unfortunate accidents in Highway intersections.
It'll help to create fast passages for emergency vehicles like fire brigade , Police,ambulances,VIP and miltary convoys also.
It'll encourage slow driving (which is safe).
It'll enable general public to use thei computers and phones to earn from traffic(Like crypto  mining).
It'll also correct mistakes of the driver while driving .(EX-Like speeding up near schools temples)
It'll provide statistics on road conditions in different areas.(Data collected by sensors deployed in public transport vehicles).



It will use semi-block chain because conventional blockchain will be too sloew for this purpose.
General public will be aloowed to join the network...They'll have to serve public by using their computation power .




Architecture:
It'll have n number of central servers to authenticate users and verify ledger data(to be explained later).
Client's device will be connected to two ledger(public) the ledger has to process some mathematical calculations and then it sends outputs to central server . 
The cental server verifies data and sends it to client's device.

Business:
Google ADs(Location based promotions of local shops, malls etc) one can avoid ADs by driving slow.
